            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
            meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
            of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants
            are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among
            the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms
            of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty,
            who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal
            love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an
            eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my
            eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its
            power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with
            longing, Oh, would I describe these conceptions , could impress upon
            paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might
            be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite
            God!
          </p>
          <p className="gadgets__text">
            O my friend - but it is too much for my strength - I sink under the
            weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has
            taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of
            spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
            charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
            souls like mine.
          </p>
          <p className="gadgets__text">
            I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
            mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be
            incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet
            I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
